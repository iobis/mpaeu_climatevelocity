Here you find the codes used to produce the Deliverable 2.8 of MPA Europe, "Climate velocity map for European seas under recent conditions".

The underlying data is available on Bio-ORACLE v3.0 ([publication here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13813) and [package here](https://github.com/bio-oracle/biooracler)).

The study area shapefile is available on the repository [iobis/mpaeu_studyarea](https://github.com/iobis/mpaeu_studyarea)

## VoCC - conversion to `terra` functions

This analysis is mainly done through the VoCC package, as described in Garc√≠a Molinos, J., Schoeman, D. S., Brown, C. J. and Burrows, M. T. (2019), VoCC: An R package for calculating the velocity of climate change and related climatic metrics. Methods Ecol Evol. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13295

The original package was written using functions from the `raster` package. For better performance, we converted all package to work mainly with the [`terra` package](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/index.html). A version of this converted package is available here in the folder `VoCC-terra`. You can install it using `devtools::install_github("iobis/mpaeu_climatevelocity/VoCC-terra")`. Users should also refer to the original package in the repository [JorGarMol/VoCC](https://github.com/JorGarMol/VoCC)
